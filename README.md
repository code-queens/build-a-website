# Learn to code a website from scratch!
Welcome to +1 Code Queens! This repository will get you started on the path to building your very own website. Even though we are all starting from the same place, by the end of the class you will have your own unique project to show off. So let's get started!

## Find this project on GitHub
We have placed some initial code on GitHub to help you get started. GitHub is software development collaboration platform that engineers use to store and share code with each other. At it's core, GitHub enables developers to track the history of their changes using version control. That way, if they make a mistake or want to go back to a previous version of the project, they can do that using GitHub.

First go to github.com. In the search bar in the upper left hand corner, search for our repository:
```
code-queens/build-a-website
```

Here you'll find the starter code for the project. You will want to download the project to your computer so you can use VS Code to edit them as we go through the course.
1. Click the green Code button and select Download Zip
2. Move the folder that downloads to your Desktop
3. Rename the folder in the following format: CodeQueens_LAST NAME

## Add the project to Visual Studio Code
We will be using Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code) to write our code. VS Code is an integrated development environment (most people just say IDE for short), which is a fancy way of saying an application to write code. There are a lot out there, but VS Code is very popular and well supported and maintained (it's owned by Microsoft!). Even though our project is starting from GitHub, we will use VS Code to develop on our local machines, then save our changes back to GitHub when we're ready.

1. Open a new window in VS Code.
2. Click Open Folder under the Start category.
3. Find your CodeQueens folder on your Desktop and click Open

## Let's see it in action!
Navigate to your CodeQueens folder on your computer (not in VS Code) and find the index.html file there. 

Double click on the file to open it in your browser. 

Now you should be able to see the beginnings of your very first website!
